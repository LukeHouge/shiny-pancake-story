This is a story about Bob. Bob lived on a farm in Wisconsin and loved to fish. Besides fishing he loved shiny pancakes.
What are shiny pancakes? Only the most amazing breakfast food ever eaten! Or so Bob thought. One morning after fishing,
Bob was making some of his favorite shiny pancakes. He was about to begin eating his pancakes when the most brilliant idea
came to him, to put fish on his shiny pancakes. It was better than chicken and waffles. The most amazing breakfast ever. 
He had to tell everyone.
Bob ran into the town center and showed everyone his new breakfast creation. Everyone was a little skeptical at first
because nobody thought that fish and pancakes would ever go well together, but it was time for Bob to prove them wrong.
He set up a little stand in the middle of the town and began to give away free tastes of his new breakfast creation.
