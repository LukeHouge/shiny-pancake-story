This is a story about Bob. Bob lived on a farm in Wisconsin and loved to fish. Besides fishing he loved shiny pancakes.
What are shiny pancakes? Only the most amazing breakfast food ever eaten! Or so Bob thought. One morning after fishing,
Bob was making some of his favorite shiny pancakes. He was about to begin eating his pancakes when the most brilliant idea
came to him, to put fish on his shiny pancakes. It was better than chicken and waffles. The most amazing breakfast ever. 
He had to tell everyone.
Bob ran into the town center and showed everyone his new breakfast creation. Everyone was a little skeptical at first
because nobody thought that fish and pancakes would ever go well together, but it was time for Bob to prove them wrong.
He set up a little stand in the middle of the town and began to give away free tastes of his new breakfast creation.
The first people who passed his stand gave him an appalled look. Why would someone  put fish on shiny pancakes? Finally, after 
thirty minutes without any tasters, someone decided to give it a try. The took one bite and exclaimed, "This is the best
thing I have eaten in 10 years!" Immediately, people started gathering around Bob's stand. Who could give up a chance to
try a delicious meal? As people took bites out of their shiny pancakes with fish, they realized how foolish they had been
to not try out Bob's new dish. Soon, Bob became one of the most well known and reputable chefs in town.
Bob went on to open a store, and sold his new creation to everyone. The shop became such a hit it brought so much traffic and
new people to the town. The town grew famous, and everyone looked up to Bob. Bob became the towns savior and they made statues of him.
